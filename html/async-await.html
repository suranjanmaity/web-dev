    <h2>Async function</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The async function declaration declares an async function where the await keyword is permitted within the function body.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <em>async</em> and <em>await</em> keywords enables the asyncronous promise based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the neet to explicitly configure promise chain.
        </li>
        <li>
            async function may also be defined as expressions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Return value</h3>
    <p>
        a promise which will be resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an exception thrown from, or uncaught within the async function.
    </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            async function can contain zero or more await expressions.
        </li>
        <li>
            await expression make promise-returning functions behave as though they are synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected
        </li>
        <li>
            the resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression
        </li>
        <li>
            use of async and await enables the use of ordinary try/catch blocks around asynchronous code
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        NOTE:
    </h3>
    <i>
        the await keyword is only valid inside async functions within regular javascript code
        <br>
        if you use outside of async functions body, you will get a <u>syntax error</u>
